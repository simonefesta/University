DES-Python
==========

C code from Discrete Event Simulation: A First Course (by Leemis and Park) translated into Python 3.3. This is great for anyone reading the book, but is not familiar with C. C and Java versions of the code are available at http://www.math.wm.edu/~leemis/ 

Run any of the programs with 'python3 filename.py'

To run a program with a datafile, you can run either 'cat data.dat | python3 file.py' or 'python3 file.py < data.dat'. The latter will not work in Powershell/Cmd if you use Windows. 

Credit for the original C code (and most of the comments) goes to Steve Park, Larry Leemis, and Dave Geyer.
